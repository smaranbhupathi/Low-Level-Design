Open Closed principle states that any module, function, class should be open for extension but closed for modification
That means that existing code should not changes for adding a new functionality. Instead the design should allow to extend the existing functionality rather than modifing it
The design minimizes the bugs as it doesn't allowing to change the existing functionality
